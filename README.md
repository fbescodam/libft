My libft library for Codam / Ã‰cole 42

[![Grade: 114/100](https://badge42.vercel.app/api/v2/cl1o16nym001109lewimxyxs8/project/2020787)](https://github.com/JaeSeoKim/badge42)

My `lstmap` method added the element to the front instead of to the back of the list, resulting in a lower grade. Fixed in commit [2a5d3a0](https://github.com/FreekBes/42_codam_libft/commit/2a5d3a0f8dff3267327184d3029b9988fccc64b2)
